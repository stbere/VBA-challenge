For TCC-VIRT-DATA-PT-10-2022-U-LOLC-MTTH


Instructions:

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol

Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

The total stock volume of the stock.

NOTE:

Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

The result should match the following image:

Moderate solution
 
Bonus:

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

Hard solution

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

Other Considerations:

Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes.

Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.

Some assignments, like this one, contain a bonus. It is possible to achieve proficiency for this assignment without completing the bonus, but the bonus is an opportunity to further develop your skills and receive extra points for doing so.
